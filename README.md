# Estimate of Public Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub

* [Daily report](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/parente/nbestimate/blob/master/estimate.ipynb)
* [Historical counts](ipynb_counts.csv)

[Getting the count](https://github.com/search/count?q=extension%3Aipynb+nbformat_minor&ref=searchresults&type=Code) from GitHub now requires user authentication. Run `conda env create environment.yml` to create a local environment with all the necessary prerequisites. Run `update.py`, copy/paste the count from the browser window into terminal prompt, and hit enter to re-render the notebook, commit it, and push it to GitHub.
